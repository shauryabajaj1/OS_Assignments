## Overview

This repository contains all the assignments completed as part of the CSE231: Operating Systems course at IIIT Delhi. These assignments encompass a wide range of essential topics in operating systems, including scheduling, multithreading, and process handling/execution. Through these projects, we gained hands-on experience in developing and understanding the core functionalities of operating systems.

## Assignments

### 1. ELF Loader
- **Description**: Implemented an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) loader from scratch in C.
- **Key Features**: 
  - Parsed ELF headers
  - Loaded ELF segments into memory
  - Handled relocation entries
- **Learning Outcomes**: Understanding of how executable files are structured and how operating systems load and execute these files.

### 2. UNIX Shell
- **Description**: Developed a shell for UNIX systems that can execute basic commands and handle various operations.
- **Key Features**: 
  - Command parsing and execution
  - Built-in commands (e.g., `cd`, `exit`)
  - Support for background execution (&)
- **Learning Outcomes**: Deepened knowledge of UNIX system calls and process management.

### 3. Shell Scheduler
- **Description**: Created a scheduler for the previously developed shell.
- **Key Features**: 
  - Implemented various scheduling algorithms (e.g., Round Robin, Priority Scheduling)
  - Managed multiple processes and ensured efficient CPU utilization
- **Learning Outcomes**: Gained insight into process scheduling and the importance of different scheduling algorithms.

### 4. Multithreading Program
- **Description**: Developed a program to handle multithreading operations.
- **Key Features**: 
  - Created multiple threads to perform concurrent tasks
  - Implemented synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, semaphores) to avoid race conditions
- **Learning Outcomes**: Enhanced understanding of multithreading, thread synchronization, and the challenges of concurrent programming.

## Conclusion

These assignments have significantly contributed to our understanding of operating systems and provided us with the practical skills needed to develop system-level software. We hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to delve into the intricacies of operating systems.
